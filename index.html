    <h1>MY TOP 3 FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
    <p class="topparagraph">
      There are many programming languages in the world that are frequently used
      for various purposes such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Software development</li>
      <li>Creating video games</li>
      <li>Making apps</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="topparagraph">
      But there are three programming languages that I consider my favorites:

            <p>
              Lua is one of the most beginner-friendly programming languages.
              It's one of my favorites because it's efficient to work with and
              easy to learn as it only has 20 defined keywords.
            </p>

              Python is a powerful programming languages used by software and
              app developers as well as video game developers. It is also easy
              to install and experiment with, and it took me only a few weeks to
              get used to it.

              C# is mainly used for developing a wide range of programs. It is
              supported by game engines such as Unity and Godot, which makes
              this one of my favorite programming languages.
